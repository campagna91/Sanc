Development of an unconventional authentication system

SANC is an academic project, the subject of a thesis developed in collaboration with the company Zucchetti - Padova office located in Via Giovanni Cittadella, personally supervised by Mr. Gregorio Piccoli.

The Not Conventional Authentication System (acronym SANC) aimed to demonstrate authentication through the use of OTP codes to an application, as a replacement for the traditional password.

Something that nowadays is practically a necessity.
